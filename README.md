# 5minBot
The Terran bot plays macro bio. A notable feature is the drop play.

At this stage the bot has a fair chance to beat the inbuilt insane AI (sc2::Difficulty::CheatInsane). It won season 3 of the Starcraft 2 AI Ladder.

The bot is always work in progress. I can not guarantee that it is always working as intended. The list of known bugs is still growing with every game...

If you use my bot as sparing partner for your bot (this is my intention with uploading it to github) feel free to drop me a message in the discord channel https://discord.gg/qTZ65sh Archiatrus#3053

The starting point of this bot was the CommandCenter bot by David Churchill cloned mid November.
