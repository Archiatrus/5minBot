# 5minBot
Terran Bot for the Sc2 AI ladder at http://sc2ai.net/. The bot plays macro bio. A notable feature is the drop play.

At this stage the bot has a fair chance to beat the inbuilt insane AI (sc2::Difficulty::CheatInsane). It won season 3 of the SC2 AI ladder at http://sc2ai.net/.

The bot is always work in progress. I can not guarantee that it is always working as intended. The list of known bugs is still growing with every game...

The starting point of this bot was the CommandCenter bot by David Churchill cloned mid November.
